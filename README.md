## About me

Hello, my name is Oleksandr Subbotin, I am a software tester from Ukraine (actually live in Poland).
I have a strong desire to launch a career in manual software testing.
I've decided
Here I would like to present you some examples of what I know. 
My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills.
I am an IT technician by profession. I completed postgraduate studies in Computer Network Administration.
In my spare time, I take part in tests on the uTest platform and learn about new tools to support tests.
Learn on your own using Udemy's courses, tutorials, and webinars and marathons on IT, testing and
